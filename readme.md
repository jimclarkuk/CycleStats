Little project playing with the London [cycle hire scheme](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/cycling/14808.aspx)      

Current aim is to set-up a timed query of the location status [api](http://bike-stats.co.uk/). This history can then be queried to determine likelihood of there being a doc free at a location at a given time.

Uses [MySQLdb](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/), [simplejson](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/) and [pygooglechart](http://pygooglechart.slowchop.com/).O
